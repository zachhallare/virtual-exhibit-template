  overview:
    "ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a family of processors based on the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, designed to deliver high performance while consuming low power. Originally developed by Acorn Computers and now designed by Arm Holdings, ARM processors are licensed to various companies, allowing manufacturers to customize them for different applications. Their energy efficiency, flexibility, and reliable performance have made them the dominant processor architecture in smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and an increasing number of personal computers.",
